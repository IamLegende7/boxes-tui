- Write better Documentation in-code
- Write usage docs

- Make logger have a Loglevel to only display logs with a Loglevel over that

- Inputs using asyncio

- Add scroll to VerticalLayout

- Add pages widget

- Add HorizontalLayout Widget

- `Global` widget:
    - a widget to automate some annoyning function calls
    - completely optional to use
    - Task:
        - check for terminal resizeses using asyncio
        - make inputs + ticking in one function (renderring maybe too?)

- implement `old_renderring_options` -> not renderring if the renderring_options is the same as before -> no unneeded re-renderring

- make the last widget with -1 fill out all space left, as 100 mod 3 = 1 -> 1 line unused
