"The great list of stuff I'm too lazy to do"

**THIS WAS MOVED TO TODO.json / todo.py!**
        **THIS LIST IS OUTDATED!**


- Add more error handling and logging

- Write better Documentation in-code
- Write usage docs

- Make logger have a Loglevel to only display logs with a Loglevel over that

- make a textbox widget -- a widget simmilar to the label, but with multiline support

- Inputs using asyncio
- single Keybind class instead of a ton of tuples

- Add scroll to VerticalLayout
- make ids usable in widget (maybe (optionally) "searching" components by their id instead of their index?)
- make functions passed in with components beeing able to be passed in as a tuple with their arguments

- Add pages widget

- Add HorizontalLayout Widget

- `Global` widget:
    - a widget to automate some annoyning function calls
    - completely optional to use
    - Task:
        - check for terminal resizeses using asyncio
        - make inputs + ticking in one function (renderring maybe too?)

- implement `old_renderring_options` -> not renderring if the renderring_options is the same as before -> no unneeded re-renderring
